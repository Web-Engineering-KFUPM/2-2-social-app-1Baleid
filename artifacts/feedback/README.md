## How marks were deducted (if any)

- This autograder ignores HTML comments (examples inside comments do NOT count).
- Checks only top-level tags and a few basic attributes (action/method/target/required).
- It does not check classes, ids, or inner text.
- Optional TODOs are ignored.
- Missing required items reduce marks proportionally within a step.
